                        Our project, "MrV Stores," is a comprehensive web application designed to provide users with information about various bikes, their specifications, features, and more. It incorporates HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.

                        We've used a responsive design approach, ensuring that the website looks and functions well across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utility classes have played a crucial role in achieving this responsiveness.

                <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                    <p>
                        We've implemented interactive elements like color selectors for bikes, dynamic content loading, and a user-friendly interface for a seamless browsing experience. Bootstrap's modals, carousels, and buttons have been used to enhance user interaction.
